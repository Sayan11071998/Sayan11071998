# 💫 About Me

**Gameplay Programmer focused on Unreal Engine (C++), with professional experience in Unity (C#).**

I specialize in building core gameplay systems such as combat mechanics, player controllers, AI behavior, animation-driven interactions, and performance-aware gameplay logic. My work emphasizes clean, modular code that supports iteration, scalability, and strong collaboration between engineering and design.

Professionally, I’ve worked on shipping hyper-casual mobile games for Android and iOS, contributing to gameplay loops, UI flows, performance optimization, analytics integration, and monetization pipelines. This experience has given me a solid understanding of real-world production constraints, rapid iteration cycles, and data-driven decision-making.

Alongside professional work, I actively develop Unreal Engine gameplay prototypes to deepen my understanding of C++ gameplay systems, AI logic, and engine-level features such as animation notifies, motion warping, and runtime optimization. These projects are used to practice scalable system design and real gameplay problem-solving beyond tutorials.
